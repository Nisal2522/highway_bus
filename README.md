## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Express Bus and Tour Management System** is a **web-based platform** designed to solve real-world transport issues faced by **passengers, bus owners, and administrators**.  
Currently, most long-distance and highway bus bookings are handled via **phone calls or manual methods**, leading to **errors, delays, and lack of transparency**.  

This system provides a **modern, digital solution** to automate the process — from booking to payments — while ensuring reliability and accountability.

---

## 🎯 Main Objectives

- Provide a centralized online platform for **bus and tour bookings**  
- Allow **bus owners** to manage schedules and receive transparent payments  
- Enable **administrators** to verify, approve, and monitor system activities  
- Improve efficiency with **secure transactions** and **automated reports**  
- Build a scalable solution with **future mobile app integration**
